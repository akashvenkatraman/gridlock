## **OPENING: The $1.8 Billion Blind Spot (Scroll 0%)**
**Speaker**: *Akash*
*(Screen shows: "Forensic Audit of 60,001 Records")*

"Good morning judges. We are Team Data Masters, and this is **Project GRIDLOCK**.

New York City spends **$1.8 billion** on Vision Zero to save lives. But we found that for years, the city has been flying blind.
Our forensic audit of 60,001 crash records revealed that nearly **half** of the data—including the deadliest expressway crashes—was effectively invisible to city planners.

This isn't just a website. It's the roadmap they were missing."

## **PART 1: The Crime Scene (Scroll 20%)**
**Speaker**: *Avvudaiyappan*
*(Scroll down to "Data Forensics" - Compare Cards)*

"Here is the data reality.
On the left, the **Legacy Dataset**. It had **52% integrity**.
We found **3,500 ghost records** dated in the future—January 2026.
We found **80 different ways** to write 'Sedan'.
It was analytically paralyzing.

On the right, **Forensic Clean**.
We didn't just clean it; we engineered it.
- We standardized **100% of dates**.
- We flagged **8,342 vulnerable user crashes** (Cyclists & Pedestrians)—Vision Zero's top priority.
- And crucially, we recovered **24,500 missing coordinates**."

## **PART 2: The Reveal (Scroll 40%)**
**Speaker**: *Harish*
*(Scroll to the Interactive Map - Pause)*

"This is the most critical moment.
*(Drag slider to LEFT)*
This empty map is what NYC saw. The Belt Parkway and FDR Drive looked safe because the sensors were failing.

*(Drag slider to RIGHT - Explain the Red)*
**This is what we revealed.**
Those red clusters? That's **24,500 crashes** that just appeared on the map.
We used Regex pattern mining to extract location data from text fields, recovering **98%** of the lost data.
Every red dot represents a potential life saved if resources are deployed there."

## **PART 3: Hidden Dangers (Scroll 60%)**
**Speaker**: *Harish*
*(Scroll to "Hidden Dangers")*

"Because of our recovery, we uncovered high-risk intersections that were previously unranked.
1.  **Belt Parkway & Bay Parkway**: Severity Score of 28. Compeletely hidden before our audit.
2.  **Grand Concourse**: A pedestrian nightmare that was under-reported due to poor infrastructure.

*(Scroll slightly to Timeline)*
And looking at our **Seasonality Timeline**, we see specific spikes that correlate with sensor failures and holiday traffic. We can now predict these surges."

## **PART 4: Native Analytics (Scroll 80%)**
**Speaker**: *Akash*
*(Scroll to "Crash Analytics")*

"Our native analytics engine now runs on the clean, engineered data.
- **Brooklyn** is the highest risk borough—it needs a $200K sensor upgrade immediately.
- **Peak Danger** is at **5:00 PM**.
- **Driver Inattention** is the #1 cause (28% of crashes).

We can finally see the truth."

## **CLOSING: The Future Outlook (Scroll 95%)**
**Speaker**: *Akash*
*(Scroll to "Predictive Risk Model")*

"But we don't just look back. We predict.
Our model forecasts a **15% severity spike** on Queens Blvd tomorrow.

**Our Recommendation:**
Shift **$270 million**—just 15% of the Vision Zero budget—to the high-risk corridors we recovered today.
We project this will result in a **30-40% reduction** in highway fatalities by 2028.

We have handed over the **Clean CSV** and the **Power BI Dashboard** to the judges.
The data is ready. The insights are clear.
Thank you."
